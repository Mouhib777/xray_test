# X-ray Anomaly Detection

This project is a Python computer vision script that reads X-ray images and returns the name of the detected anomaly.

## Features

- Load and preprocess X-ray images
- Detect if an X-ray image shows pneumonia or is normal (placeholder logic)
- Uses Pillow and PyTorch (can be extended with real models)

## Usage

1. Place your X-ray images in the `images/` folder (e.g., pneumonia_train1.jpeg).
2. Run the main script to see if each image is detected as 'Pneumonia' or 'Normal'.

## Setup

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Extending

Replace the placeholder logic in `main.py` with a real pneumonia detection model for production use.
