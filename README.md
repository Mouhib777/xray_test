# X-ray Anomaly Detection

This project is a Python computer vision script that reads X-ray images and returns the name of the detected anomaly.

## Features
- Load and preprocess X-ray images
- Placeholder for anomaly classification (extendable with real models)
- Uses OpenCV, Pillow, and PyTorch or TensorFlow

## Usage
1. Place your X-ray images in the `images/` folder.
2. Run the main script to get anomaly predictions.

## Setup
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Extending
Replace the placeholder model with a real anomaly detection model for production use.
